# Search OED Extension for Safari #

Look up a word in the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oed.com/) from the context menu. 

The full OED requires authentication. Supply a valid library card number (from a subscribing library) in the settings to enable the extension to automatically log in to the OED website.

Compiled extension available from [lowest-common-denominator.com](http://lowest-common-denominator.com/downloads/safari-extensions/oed-search/oed-search.safariextz).

I think the phrase 'limited usecase' sums up the likely appeal of this extension.
